    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>Thankyou for taking time out to read about me but hey i hope i wont bore you talking about my passion for technology (will try not to). Computers, smartphones or smartwatches whatever latest tech there is i like getting my hands on.</p>
    <p>Apart from the machinery i like discovering new places (for food), travelling to london to try some jerk chicken well why not when it takes you to heaven.</p>
    <p>As mentioned above you will know i love travelling and meeting new people (food included). There is a long list of countries i have yet to conquer and maybe that will happen once  graduate.</p>
    <p>Currently in 1st year at The University of Northampton and only a few weeks in but already flooded with assignments.</p>
